# PHP Simple Encryption (php-simple-encryption)

A PHP library that makes encryption and decryption of text easy.

## Requirements

- PHP 7.2+
- Openssl PHP extension

## Installation

Simply add a dependency on `stymiee/php-simple-encryption` to your project's `composer.json` file if you 
use [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) to manage the dependencies of your project.

Here is a minimal example of a `composer.json` file that just defines a dependency on PHP Simple Encryption:

    {
        "require": {
            "stymiee/php-simple-encryption": "^1"
        }
    }

## Basic Usage

To get a more detailed introduction to this library, visit the 
[PHP Simple Encryption tutorial](https://www.johnconde.net/blog/php-simple-encryption/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=php-encryption)
on my blog.

```php
require('./vendor/autoload.php');

use Encryption\Encryption;
use Encryption\Exception\EncryptionException;

$text = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog';
$key  = 'secretkey';
try {
    $encryption = Encryption::getEncryptionObject();
    $iv = $encryption->generateIv();
    $encryptedText = $encryption->encrypt($text, $key, $iv);
    $decryptedText = $encryption->decrypt($encryptedText, $key, $iv);

    printf('Cipher   : %s%s', $encryption->getName(), PHP_EOL);
    printf('Encrypted: %s%s', $encryptedText, PHP_EOL);
    printf('Decrypted: %s%s', $decryptedText, PHP_EOL);
    printf('Version  : %s%s', Encryption::VERSION, PHP_EOL);
}
catch (EncryptionException $e) {
    echo $e;
}
```
    
Outputs

    Cipher   : AES-256-CBC
    Encrypted: lierDqV4Qo3Cm87YU01K+YnQsDGrFsYypjHJVZaagqfLFg7xb2T7b9qfqb4NcoIGcTzqvQbOx72AVgbuRFxqgg==
    Decrypted: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
    Version  : 1

An exception may be thrown if:
- An invalid/unsupported cipher is attempted to be used (`Encryption\Exception\InvalidCipherException`)
- A cipher available in openssl but yet implemented is attempted to be used (`Encryption\Exception\CipherNotImplementedException`)
- `generateIv()` is unable to generate a initialization vector (`\RuntimeException`).

## Supported Ciphers

The PHP Simple Encryption library currently defaults to `AES-256-CBC`. This may change in future versions and will 
result in a major version bump when this occurs. You can check the version of your library by calling
`Encryption::VERSION`. This library is currently on version "1".
 
To determine what cipher you are using you can call the `getName()` method on your encryption object.

```php
$encryption = Encryption::getEncryptionObject();
$cipherName = $encryption->getName(); // AES-256-CBC
```
    
To get a list of ciphers supported by your system *and* this library you can call `Encryption::listAvailableCiphers()`
to receive an array of available ciphers. This list is an intersection of available ciphers from your system's
installed version of Openssl and ciphers supported by this library.    

**Total ciphers supported:** 132    
**Default cipher:** AES-256-CBC (version 1)

## Notes

If the text to be encrypted contains trailing null characters they will be removed when decrypting those values.

## Support

If you require assistance using this library start by viewing the [HELP.md](HELP.md) file included in this package. It 
includes common problems and their solutions.

If you need additional assistance, I can be found at Stack Overflow. Be sure when you
[ask a question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=php,encryption,openssl) pertaining to the usage of
this library be sure to tag your question with the **PHP** and **encryption** tags. Make sure you follow their
[guide for asking a good question](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) as poorly asked questions will be closed, 
and I will not be able to assist you.

A good question will include all the following:
- A description of the problem (what are you trying to do? what results are you expecting? what results are you actually getting?)
- The code you are using (only post the relevant code)
- Your unencrypted text
- The key you are using
- The IV you are using
- The output of your method call(s)
- Any error message(s) you are getting

**Do not use Stack Overflow to report bugs.** Bugs may be reported [here](https://github.com/stymiee/php-simple-encryption/issues/new).
